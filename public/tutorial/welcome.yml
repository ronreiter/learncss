  Welcome to the interactive Learn CSS tutorial!
  
  This course teaches CSS using simple and interactive examples. 
  Since CSS is a visual language, our mind understands and memorizes the CSS commands better when taught visually. 
  
  This tutorial will help you:
  * Learn the basics of CSS
  * Understand how each CSS property is used in relation to a child or a parent element
  * Understand how changing every CSS property affects the visuals of the page

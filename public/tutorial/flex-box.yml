title: Flexbox Layout
description: |
  Flexbox is probably the strongest and most useful layout mechanism used today.
  The general idea of the layout mechanism is to describe how elements within a container are positioned
  accross the main axis.
  
  In this example, the main axis is __horizontal__ because the direction of the main axis goes from left to right.

  To enable Flexbox layout, a parent element must be defined with the CSS property `display: flex`.
  No Flexbox property will work without specifying it, so keep this in mind. 

  In the Flexbox layout, the parent element is called the **container** whereas the children of the element
  are called the **items**.

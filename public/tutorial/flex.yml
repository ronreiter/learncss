title: "Display: Flex"
description: |
  Display specifies the type of layout that the component uses. With Flexbox, the parent element must be
  defined as `display: flex` in order for the children of that element to be affected by the flexbox layout.
  
  Note that this property does **not** affect the parent element at all, only the children.
